CI/CD Pipeline for Node.js Application

Overview

This repository demonstrates a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Node.js application. The pipeline is implemented using Jenkins and integrates with Docker and Kubernetes to automate testing, building, and deploying the application.

Features

•	Automated Testing: Runs tests on every pull request to ensure code quality.

•	Docker Image Build: Packages the application into a Docker image.

•	Kubernetes Deployment: Deploys the Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster.

•	Notifications: Sends success or failure notifications.

Architecture

•	Source Control: GitHub repository to manage the Node.js application's source code.

•	CI/CD Pipeline:
o	Runs tests using npm test.

o	Builds and pushes a Docker image to Docker Hub.

o	Deploys the image to Kubernetes using kubectl.

•	Deployment Target: Kubernetes cluster.

Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure the following are set up:

•	Jenkins: Installed on a server or accessible through Jenkins Cloud. Plugins:

o	Pipeline

o	Docker Pipeline

o	Kubernetes CLI

o	Slack Notification (optional)

•	Docker Hub: Account and credentials to push the Docker image.

•	Kubernetes Cluster: Access to a cluster configured with kubectl.

•	GitHub Repository: Webhooks enabled to trigger Jenkins jobs on pull requests.

Pipeline Workflow

Stages

•	Checkout Code: Clones the repository from the main branch.

•	Install Dependencies: Runs npm install to install required packages.

•	Run Tests: Executes npm test to verify application functionality.

•	Build Docker Image: Creates a Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub.

•	Deploy to Kubernetes:

o	Applies k8s/deployment.yaml and k8s/service.yaml to deploy the application.

•	Post-Deployment: Sends notifications for success or failure.

How to use

1.	Fork or Clone the Repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/khandu7498/nodejs-ci-cd-pipeline.git
    cd nodejs-ci-cd-pipeline
  	
4.	Set Up Jenkins:
   
•	Create a Jenkins pipeline job.

•	Link the repository to the pipeline.

•	Add necessary credentials (Docker, Kubernetes). my-project

7.	Configure Kubernetes:
   
•	Apply the YAML files in the k8s/ directory to your Kubernetes cluster:
            kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
            
            kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
            
9.	Trigger the Pipeline:
    
•	Push changes or create a pull request to trigger the pipeline.

Notifications

Configure notifications for deployment success or failure:

•	Slack: Add Slack Notification Plugin in Jenkins and configure the webhook URL.

•	Email: Add Email Notification settings in Jenkins.
